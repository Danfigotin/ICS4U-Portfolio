                <p class = "summary">Intro to Js was one of my first ever units. I finished it in grade nine and it brings many awesome memories. But I'm here to talk about what I learned. Throughout this unit, I learned many things about what is programming and how it works. As well as, some simple code on how to draw things using lines, rect, and ellipses. However, near the end, it got harder. But it was still an awesome learning experience. In this unit, you also learn how to use if/else statements and a random function that randomizes. Learning these helped me a lot throughout the class. Some of my favorite projects include: Magic 8-ball and Make it rain. Because they were very interesting and when I finished them I remember being very happy.</p>

                <h4 class = "summaryTitle">Summary</h4>
                <p class = "summary">Intro to HTML/CSS was one of the most useful units in my opinion and I highly recommend going through the lessons and some projects. In this unit, I learned the basics of HTML and some CSS, but mostly HTML. I learned how HTML tags work and where they go, which was pretty important. As important I learned how to add images and lists which helped make things more organized and interesting. CSS is not my favorite but it's very useful. With CSS you learn how to change font colors, background colors, and highlighting things. This is done by adding classes or ids to tags. Doing this makes it easier to change things for specifics. Another very useful thing is commenting. Comments can be very useful in code because they are one of the main, if not the main organizing tool to organize code. This unit teaches many awesome things like positioning, adding, removing, and how to create a simple website.</p>

                <h4 class = "summaryTitle">Summary</h4>
                <p class = "summary">Advanced Js: Games & Visualizations is my favorite unit. Because you learn how to create awesome games like mathcing/memory games and a funny hopping game. In this unit you learn how to use a lot of useful functions like buttons or mouseClicked. You also learn about collision and how it works, this can be very useful if your making a game where you take damage. Overall this unit has taken good impact on me because it helped me a lot throughtout this class and past courses. I would 100% reccommend.</p>
