                <p class = "summary">Intro to Js was one of my first ever units. I finished it in grade nine and it brings many awesome memories. But I'm here to talk about what I learned. Throughout this unit, I learned many things about what is programming and how it works. As well as, some simple code on how to draw things using lines, rect, and ellipses. However, near the end, it got harder. But it was still an awesome learning experience. In this unit, you also learn how to use if/else statements and a random function that randomizes. Learning these helped me a lot throughout the class. Some of my favorite projects include: Magic 8-ball and Make it rain. Because they were very interesting and when I finished them I remember being very happy.</p>

                <h4 class = "summaryTitle">Summary</h4>
                <p class = "summary">Intro to HTML/CSS was one of the most useful units in my opinion and I highly recommend going through the lessons and some projects. In this unit, I learned the basics of HTML and some CSS, but mostly HTML. I learned how HTML tags work and where they go, which was pretty important. As important I learned how to add images and lists which helped make things more organized and interesting. CSS is not my favorite but it's very useful. With CSS you learn how to change font colors, background colors, and highlighting things. This is done by adding classes or ids to tags. Doing this makes it easier to change things for specifics. Another very useful thing is commenting. Comments can be very useful in code because they are one of the main, if not the main organizing tool to organize code. This unit teaches many awesome things like positioning, adding, removing, and how to create a simple website.</p>

                <h4 class = "summaryTitle">Summary</h4>
                <p class = "summary">Advanced Js: Games & Visualizations was pretty hard from what I remember because I did it in grade nine. So, this was a very big review for me. This module is very interesting because you learn how to create awesome games like mathcing/memory games and a funny hopping game. In this unit you learn how to use a lot of useful functions like buttons or mouseClicked. You also learn about collision and how it works, this can be very useful if your making a game where you take damage. Finally, they shows you many ways to use different loops and arrays to store or increase points. Overall this unit has taken good impact on me because it helped me a lot throughtout this class and past courses. I would 100% reccommend.</p>

                <h4 class = "summaryTitle">Summary</h4>
                <p class = "summary">Natural Simulations much harder than Games & Visualizations. Although it was hard it still had a positive impact on me. Natural Simulations taught how to think out of the box, and being creative. As well as, how to implement physics to objects like gravity. That was very interesting. Overall this module was a great challenge that I won't forget about because it was very absorbing with a lot of awesome information that I didn't even know about. </p>

                <p class = "summary">Computer Science Princples is a bit different in a way that it doesn't have projects to practice with. However, I did learn many things. Computer Science Princples had a mandatory module called Programming. Mostly knew most of the stuff they were talking about. But it was still a great JS review. In addition, the quizes there were very great in terms of they inhenced knowledge of understanding code with the use or form of Pseudocode. Some things were repetetive but it was not boring a single bit. I enjoyed every single part of it. I have completed all four modules in CS Princples with some fantastic grades/mastery points. The most challenging one was probably Digital Information, just because I was new to the Binary Numbers math, but when I got the hang of it was very interesting.</p>

                    <p class = "summary">Responsive Web Design was very new to me because I never used FreeCodeCamp before but when I got the hang of it was it was actually very fun. I also like that their is a big mandatory list the shows what you have done and what you still need to do. Also, there is a test option that shows the same thing. For my two modules I decided to do a tribute page for Tony Stark from Marvel, and a Survey Form. While working on the tribute page I started using the margins to center and space out objects. Throughout that I also learned some cool CSS option like shading behind text. Using this knowledge I decided to make a survey relating to Tony called "Stark Industries Survey Form", in this project I enhanced my HTML even more. I began using ids more as well as classes. Also, using inputs was very interesting. Overall I really liked these two modules and they taught me a lot in a very engaging way. </p>
