        <p class = "aboutMe">Hello my name is Daniel Figotin, I am 16 years old and a grade 11 student at A. Y. Jackson High School. I can speak Russian and English, and I can understand Hebrew pretty well. My favourite subject is Computer Science because it is a very absorbing subject, and I enjoy programming and working on awesome projects like this one. Also, I like working with computers and playing video games, I'm currently playing Elder Scrolls Online, but I enjoy playing other games as well like CS:GO, Battlefield, Diablo III, Overwatch, etc.  </p>

            <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class = "aboutMe">Before high school I didn't know how coding languages worked, but I did watch a lot of awesome videos on how to make cool and simple games like flappy bird, because it seemed pretty cool. Therefore, In grade nine I decided to take Computer Science and learned about the basics of JavaScript(JS) as well as some html, but very little, and it was actually an awesome learning expierience. Going forward, in grade ten I decided to pursue Computer Science because it was something that I enjoyed, I learned about C++ and made some interesting projects like the Pig Dice game and Matching games. Through the working on these projects I learned about the basics of C++ and I was able to solve some challenging problems. Right now is 2021 and I am finishing the final Computer Science course aka. ICS4U. In this class I learned many awesome things and I also increased my knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and learned how to use CSS. Using this knowledge, I worked on some pretty cool projects including this Portfolio website. </p>

                <hr>
                <p class = "aboutMe">I love working with computers and programming and I enjoy learning new and challanging things. Computer Science is perfect for that. Because when you're working on something, you all ways find something new, which is something I like. As well as, there are so many more languages other than JavaScript and HTML. Such as, Python, Ruby, Java, C, etc. To be learned.  In the future, I'm going to continue pursueing Computer Science and hopefully work as a Software Developer when I'm older because it's description includes many things that I enjoy doing.</p>
