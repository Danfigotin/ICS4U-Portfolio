## Three Questions:

## Summarize your experience with freecodecamp.
Starting to work with Freecodecamp was very strange to me because I've been working only with Khan Academy since grade 9. However, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try it out. So far, it's been great! In my opinion, the lessons are a bit more interesting than Khan Academy but both are good. For the lessons, I did the CSS and the Html, and most of the stuff that I did there was pretty easy because I already have learned about them in Khan from experience. Although I knew most of the stuff, it was still a fantastic, review. Also, I'm working on getting a certification there. I would 100% recommend trying FreeCodeCamp because it's 'free' and it's an awesome learning experience.

In adittion, I did two modules there. The tribute page and the survey. Throughout these modules I have began to use a lot of things from my knowledge that would usually just be not used. For example, In Khan Academy they taught me how to margin and position curten things. However, I never really used them anywhere. Using them in these modules was very refreshing and fun.

## What does it mean to have good programming practices?
To have a good programming practice does not mean working for 10 hours straight non-stop. To have a good programming practice means to learn something enjoyably. Throughout this course I had some ups and downs because I had English on top of the work. However, the way Khan Academy and FreeCodeCamp works and the organazied lessons they have actually made everything much easier in terms of learning, it wasn't 'mumbly'. Also, working with people was an awesome learning experience because you learn from each others mistakes. For example, I was doing the creative project with Gal, and we would explain things to each other if one didn't understand something. So, teamwork is fantastic practice.

Finally, from personal expirience Back in grade 10, I was working with C++ and I would sometimes get stuck on some projects or challenging questions. Me being very competitive at the time I would just stare at them until an idea would just pop in my head on how to solve them. This lead to me getting pretty exhausted and frustrated, which lead to me giving up sometimes. That was very sad to me because I enjoy working with computers and programming, and to see this come down a hill I decided to change things. Which then lead to what I do now. I take 2, 2-hour breaks. By doing this, I don't get tired, and I have fun and enjoy working on awesome projects.

## How will you continue learning about computer science?
There are so many things that I love about programming and computer science. One is you always find something new, or something to learn. Anything that I watch, or try I always find new and awesome strategies. I will continue working on Khan Academy, and try and finish everything there. Secondly, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try FreeCodeCamp, and it's been a pretty awesome learning experience and review of what I already know. These are going to be the main focuses for now. However, I will also try Dan Shifman's live coding challenges and maybe even participate in a hackathon someday. After around three years of learning to code, I have found and can confirm that there is always something to learn!
