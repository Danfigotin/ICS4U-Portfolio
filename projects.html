    <p class = "giphyP">This is David's group project. It's called blackhole. For my refactoring I decided to change the UFO image file to a plane. Second thing that I did is I changed the value of c so that it would be a little more challenging to land the plane in the 'blackhole'. Finally, I changed the background colour because it was very bright, so I made it a bit easier on the eyes.</p>

    <p class = "giphyP">For my second refactoring I used Jason's and Mhadi's Starfieldgroup project. Because it's very snowy in Canada, I decided to change the stars to look more like snow. To do that, I changed the speed, direction where it is coming from (top left), and finally increasing the quantity that spawns.</p>
